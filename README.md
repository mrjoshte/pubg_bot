# PUG-BOT

## Welcome to my PUBG-BOT

This project has just been started so I will update this as I go..

I am using https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/ in order to communicate with the discord api
and https://github.com/javilobo8/pubg-api-redis in order to communicate with the pubg tracker api

Update for the future

- Update the win posting if players won a match together
- autopost updated leaderboard changes as they happen
- add !disgrace @player and list out all of their undesireable stats
